Here for you write a description you want
for me let me write the steps you need for this project
first open the terminal and go to repository alx-higher_level_programming
then create a directory using mkdir 0x05-python-exceptions
after creating change the current directory to this directory
then write the codes i show in vi accordingly
and the main codes are there in the projects so you can simply use them but i'll show you
and to check the codes like ./ filename you need to make the file excutable and for that use chmod u+x filename
and if you want to make the whle file excuatable use chmod -R 777 * 
thanks sam tech
